You need to create a django project to manage users.
1. You need to creat 2 db tables:

  i. Users table: It will contain all the users

  ii. Addresses table: It will contain addresses of users
 The tables are going to have 2 different views in admin panel, one for each

2. You need to create 3 different users:

  i. Admin user: He is going to have all the accesses to crud both the tables
 
 ii. Staff user: He can view both user and adresses views but can only modify addresses.

iii. Customer service user; He can view just the addresses table, but cannot modify anything.

PS: There is no need to beautify the project. It should be simple and functional.
